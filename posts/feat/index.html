Still, companies are manufacturing new feature phones, and people are going back to them for their convenience and minimalistic approach.

Well, it is not the sole reason, but for many, including myself, it might be the main selling point. These are cheaper even than the most low-end smartphones. If cutting your cost is your priority, why not give it a shot instead of buying a flagship phone once every year. A feature phone easily lasts for a decent amount of years, as mine is in its fifth year now. It is surely worth the bucks.\nSick of buying tempered glasses and covers for your phone? Why not give these feature phones a try? These phones are famous for their durability and are compact in every way. You might have had a good laugh at those Nokia memes. There are a plethora of durability tests on the internet certifying their compactness, and these phones hardly fall behind in that.\nIf making calls is your priority, these phones can serve you well. Every phone can do that, but feature phones have always done that in the simplest way. In case of emergencies, they can come in handy.\nThe web of internet surrounds us zoomers all the time. So it is given that sometimes we become sick of it. A much-needed respite from this can be utilized greatly if one is using a feature phone. First of all, it is hard to use social media sites on your dumb phone, which can help you to curb your overall screen time. Other reasons might be like you have this sudden urge to check what is trending on TikTok lately, but then you find that there isn’t any app named TikTok out there. This saves you from unwanted cringe, keeping your mental health in check.\nSome of us are paranoid about our privacy. Isn’t the paranoia justified concerning how different sites often track our movement on the internet? But it is not all grim news. Feature phones might be a suitable solution to get rid of those telemetry apps that we are constantly using on our smartphones.\nWell, Mr. Zucc, it was a pleasure having you around.\nAlso, these phones occupy less space in the pocket. While walking, smartphones can be a real bummer. As I don’t want my smartphone to keep bugging me all the time, I just take my dumb phone instead while going out.\nAnd those of you, who are in college, in most cases, the authority won’t let you use any smartphones on the campus. But they might allow these dumb phones. And if you’re using one, it could serve as a relief to your worrying parents.\nAnd there will be many more instances when you will be thanking your feature phone.\nSo why not turn around and be a feature phone hipster instead?\n",
