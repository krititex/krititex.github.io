They can create whatever they want with their God-given talents. They can paint a beautiful picture, build a unique company having a unique concept behind it. Such notions are common in general. And it is not true at all.\nCreativity is a process; the process of making something new by connecting existing thoughts. It is not something that comes out like a flash and boom! There you got something you have never seen before. It is not like that at all. Instead, you connect tiny bits of pieces and form a whole new thing. The creative process looks something like this. It is the culmination of experiences and practice.\nBy creating habits, you can hone your creativity. While we observe a mesmerizing artwork or excellent writing, we only see the outcome that is showed before us. However, we overlook what the person had to persevere to create those beautiful works. A good working schedule might be a great help for your creative process.\nHaruki Murakami, whose works enrapture us, did not study ‘writing’ when he started. However, he used to read a lot from a very young age. He considers reading as the most prerequisite if you want to become a writer.\nDiscipline is a pivotal thing in the creative process. Haruki himself is a disciplined man. Every day, he wakes up early in the morning. He makes himself a cup of coffee and then sits down to write. He spends 4-5 hours on writing. In the afternoon he runs for ten kilometers or swims for fifteen hundred meters. While writing, he has to focus for a long time, and eventually, his mind gets jaded. Exercise appeases his mind and prepares him ready for the next day. At night, he goes to bed around nine p.m. This routine, he has been following it ever since. On an average day, he writes 800-1,200 words in the morning. With both physical and mental energy, he has been able to adhere to this schedule so far. And we got some phenomenal works of fiction.\nBy reading and experiencing different things, he accumulated the ingredients for his writing. And through writing regularly, he consolidates those pieces into a form of fiction. This cycle keeps him going.\nSimilar to Haruki Murakami; Stephen King, one of the most prolific writers in current time, writes about 2,000 words a day. And he makes sure not to miss a day.\nCreativity is like building a muscle, you have to work through it every day. Psychology professor Barbara Kerr suggests, “approximately 22 percent of the variance [in creativity] is due to the influence of genes.” Some people are more creative than others, however, almost everyone is born with some creative skills. Therefore, assuming yourself as not creative is a pretty weak excuse to give.\n",
