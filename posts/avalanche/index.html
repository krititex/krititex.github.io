The crispy wind drifted through the narrow valleys, carrying the sweet smell that genially spoke of spring. It was another lovely afternoon in the country sides. The steam rising from the mug blurred my vision as I gazed at the mountains. In no time, I found myself in the chasms of my past, surfing through the evens and the odds.\nIt was pretty early in my climbing career. Being as passionate as one could be, I craved to grab every opportunity out there. Given my enthusiasm, I did not hesitate when I learned about that particular summit. Being a remote peak in the Himalayas, it had gained little popularity back then. But there was something in there that made me want to climb.\nI took off from the base camp rather early. The air was quite cold, and the glacial ambiance was always there. Besides, it was harder to climb in that season. But as I was impatient, I wanted to climb as soon as possible. The path kept becoming steep as time went by. Frost crept around me, invading my senses altogether, leaving my soul more determined than ever. I wanted to pour my strength, my hope, and my teachings all into it.\nIt took me seven entire days to reach the summit. The sun was already down. A piece of moon hung low in the sky, casting its ethereal glow, framing an idyllic, enchanted scene. Everything seemed infinitesimal up from there, even the large village a few kilometers away felt tiny against the sky.\nWe, humans, were puny creatures. Despite that, at the peak of the mountain, I felt like a behemoth. The sky still looked far away, away from my reach. But I felt like I could still touch the sky, just for that moment. I can’t describe the feelings in mere words. That’s what it was.\nI wished to stay there for a long time, but the weather had bad news for me. And I knew better. I started descending. I knew the risks of climbing, and despite knowing all these, I had chosen this job. I would be the one to blame if something bad happened. I had heard stories about climbers dying; becoming amputated all the time. We who climbed all knew this. Accidents weren’t aberrant. But what I expected the least happened. It was an avalanche.\nI hadn’t reached halfway in my descent then. I started having difficulty in breathing, my body went chill from the clammy wind. It was strange, consid- ering how I felt at the top. I saw ice starting to roll down at a sturdy pace, like those high waves in the sea. Watching it rushing towards me seized me numb. They fumed my vision, and I no longer could maintain my stance. I became disoriented.\nMy cords got dismantled, and the next thing I knew, I was falling along with the snow. A gelid numbness permeated into my fleshes as I hit something as solid as rock. I remember nothing after that. It’s like that moment in my life never occurred once.\nThey claimed to find me submerged in the snow; unconscious. They told me as if it was a miracle that I could even return with my bare life, having some severe bone fractures. It took several months to rehabilitate. But that incident deeply changed me on the inside. After that, I left my house, from the grips of my abusive brother. Surviving an avalanche, did a great job of breaking the plateau that had solidified over the years, cause that itself needed a lot of courage.\nAs I was subjected to abuse, I always lacked self-confidence. Seeing people triumphing over the mountains, exploring the unknowns, I always found climbing to be courageous. That’s why I chose to be one.\nAfter that expedition and returning from the verge of death, I finally understood that even if I had submitted myself to the longtime abuse, there was still time to act, to get myself out of that house. And that’s what I did. Since then, I had conquered tons of mountains, saw the unseen, and finally retired as an instructor in a climbing agency.\nIt had started raining by the time I finished my coffee. I came back to my cottage hastily and began to prepare to make myself a lovely dinner. It was long since I had settled myself among these lone mountains. I breathed the mountain breeze, heard the hush of the wind prevailing in the distant valleys, and ate what God had provided me with. Then I was grateful for still making it through.\n",
