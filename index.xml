      <description>Imagine yourself at an art gallery. You are looking through the beautiful paintings; done by incredible artists. Looking at those paintings, you are wondering “Wow! I wish I could be as creative as they are!” Then a sigh follows, reflecting your despair.
A majority of people think of creativity as a divine power a selected few inherently occupies. They can create whatever they want with their God-given talents. They can paint a beautiful picture, build a unique company having a unique concept behind it.</description>
